                        <p>
                            Nikola Tesla (Serbian: Никола Тесла, 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856 – 7 January 1943) 
                            was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. 
                            He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current 
                            (AC) electricity supply system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics 
                            in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the 
                            early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power 
                            industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized 
                            citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City 
                            before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his 
                            ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of 
                            electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase 
                            AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount 
                            of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually 
                            marketed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of 
                            experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early 
                            X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. 
                            Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and 
                            wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout 
                            the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power 
                            distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado 
                            Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his 
                            devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower 
                            project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding 
                            before he could complete it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with 
                            varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York 
                            hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell 
                            into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and 
                            Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla 
                            in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.

                                In total, Tesla has over 700 inventions and patents, some of which are major historical milestones 
                                in modern electricity. Tesla probably invented radio before Marconi and Popov, and also worked with 
                                X-rays before they were officially discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen.

                                    Working for Westinghouse, he patented the use of multiphase alternating current systems. 
                                    Prior to the invention of the induction motor, alternating current was not widely used 
                                    because it could not be used in pre-existing electric motors.
                                </p>

                                    In 1889 Nikola Tesla began researching high frequency and high voltage currents. 
                                    He invented the first samples of electromechanical HF generators 
                                    (including inductor type) and a high-frequency transformer (Tesla transformer, 1891), 
                                    thus creating the prerequisites for the development of a new branch of electrical 
                                    engineering - HF technology.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the research of high frequency currents Tesla also paid attention to safety 
                                    issues. Experimenting on his body, he studied the effect of alternating currents 
                                    of different frequency and strength on the human body. Many rules, first developed 
                                    by Tesla, have become part of the modern basis of safety when working with HF currents. 
                                    He discovered that at current frequencies above 700 Hz, electric current flows over the 
                                    surface of the body without harming the tissues of the body. Electrical apparatuses 
                                    developed by Tesla for medical research became widespread in the world.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Experiments with high-frequency currents of high voltage led the inventor to discover 
                                    a way to clean contaminated surfaces. Similar effects of currents on the skin showed 
                                    that it was possible to remove small rashes, clean pores and kill germs. This method 
                                    is used in modern electrotherapy.

                                    On October 12, 1887, Tesla gave a rigorous scientific description of the essence of 
                                    the rotating magnetic field phenomenon. On May 1, 1888, Tesla received his main patents 
                                    for the invention of multiphase electric machines (including an induction motor) and a 
                                    system for transmitting electricity by means of multiphase alternating current. Using 
                                    the two-phase system, which he considered the most economical, a number of industrial 
                                    electrical installations were commissioned in the United States, including the Niagara 
                                    Hydroelectric Power Plant (1895), the largest in those years[13].

                                    In 1891, Tesla described and demonstrated the principles of radio communication in a 
                                    public lecture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Tesla was one of the first to patent a method of reliably producing currents that 
                                    could be used in radio communication. U.S. Patent 447,920, issued in the United 
                                    States on March 10, 1891, described a "Method of Operating Arc-Lamps" 
                                    ("Method of Operating Arc-Lamps") in which an alternator produced high-frequency 
                                    (by the standards of the time) current oscillations on the order of 10,000 Hz. 
                                    The patented innovation was a method of suppressing the sound produced by the 
                                    arc lamp under the influence of alternating or pulsating current, for which Tesla 
                                    invented the use of frequencies beyond the perception of human hearing. According 
                                    to modern classification, the alternating current generator worked in the interval 
                                    of very low radio frequencies.

                                    In 1893, the scientist became closely involved in wireless communications and invented 
                                    the mast antenna.
